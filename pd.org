#+TITLE: The Prisoner's Dilemma

The following grid simulates how the cheater strategy (red) spreads from the center in a world of cooperators (blue):

The color yellow is used to represent cells that have recently turned into cheaters, and green to represent cells that have recently turned into cooperators.

For each round of the PD game, each player interacts with other players in its Moore neighborhood. The total payoff for each player is the sum of the pair-wise interactions with each player, including itself. In the next round, players adopt the strategy that produced the highest payoff.

In order to simplify the payoff calculation, the following payoff matrix was used

|   | C | D |
| C | 1 | 0 |
| D | T | 0 |

where 'T' (>1) is the temptation to defect.
