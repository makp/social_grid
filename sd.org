#+TITLE: Snowdrift Game

The left grid shows a random distribution of cooperators (blue) and defectors (red)---cooperators occupy cells with $80%$ probability. The right grid shows how the distribution of cooperators and defectors after they play the SD game 40 times:

Cooperators form long filaments. This is expected because, in the SD game, it pays to have a neighbor that plays an alternative strategy.

For each round of the SD game, each player interacts with other players in its Moore neighborhood. The total payoff for each player is the sum of the pair-wise interactions with each player, including itself. In the next round, players adopt the strategy that produced the highest payoff.

In order to simplify the payoff calculation, the following payoff matrix was used

|   | C | D |
| C | 1 | 1 |
| D | T | 0 |

where $T$ (>1) is the temptation to defect. In the above simulation, $T = 2.6$.
